          <p><strong>Android application that utilizes Google's Text to Speech APK to create audio files based on text input.  The application also includes an onboard dictionary, allowing the listener to document unknown words at the touch of a button for future reference.</strong></p>

<h1>
<a id="problem" class="anchor" href="#problem" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Problem</h1>

<p>Due to the busy lifestyles of many college students, time dedicated to sitting down and reading has diminished. Reading assignments, however, are constantly being given, and many students struggle to keep up with the deluge of articles. As students are unable to study from written sources, both print and electronic, on the go, a method that would enable these valuable repositories of knowledge to be fully utilized would greatly stimulate education.</p>

<h1>
<a id="our-solution" class="anchor" href="#our-solution" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our Solution</h1>

<p>We have decided to build an <strong>android phone application that allows the user to listen to audio files generated from text inputted by the user on his mobile device.</strong> As audio files are much more versatile and portable than printed resources and as cell phones are ubiquitous in all parts of life, students will be able to continue their education in places and during situations that aren't conducive to traditional reading. This will enable the user to learn from all forms of phone accessible sources, from books to newspapers to magazine articles, at all times. </p>

<h2>
<a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h2>

<p>We built several features into the application, the first of which being the ability to <strong>save sound files.</strong> When the app is run, the text inputted by the user will be converted into a sound file that will be saved; this will allow the user to return to the file at a later date and reuse it without having to regenerate it, saving both time and processing power. As repeated listening to the writing will better increase the user's understanding of the content, this functionality will facilitate improved learning.</p>

<p>We also incorporated a <strong>dictionary</strong> aspect to this app, using the Pearson Dictionaries API. While listening to tracks, users will be able to access the definition of words with which they are unfamiliar. As students will be able to do this while the sound file is being played, using the dictionary will not interrupt the user experience and will allow students to better comprehend the content they are listening to. We have also added a feature that allows users to access <strong>multiple definitions</strong> for the same word if available,</p>

<p>To increase the efficacy of this app, users can <strong>copy and paste</strong> the desired text directly into the app to have it converted into a sound file. This will allow students to make better use of this app, as it is unfeasible to expect students with limited time to type the text into the app. As long as the student can copy the text of their reading assignment, they will be able to use the app to listen to it while on the go.</p>

<h2>
<a id="summary" class="anchor" href="#summary" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h2>

<p>This app will be of great use to students on college campuses, as the need to decide between studying and activities such as exercise will be eliminated. Also, as many students are unable to read in cars or when extremely tired, this app will allow them to complete their studying in an unconventional, yet effective style. While we were not able to achieve everything that was envisioned while designing this app, this app, with the ability to save re-playable sound files generated from user inputted text and the access definitions using the Pearson Dictionary API, has the potential to improve the student's understanding of reading assignments. <strong>We believe that this app will greatly improve student's performance, both by improving the results of their current studying and by expanding the situations in which they can study.</strong></p>
